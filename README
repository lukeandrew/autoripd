autoripd
(c) 2011-2012 Tim Babb
Version 1.0

Monitor optical disk drives, then use handbrake/makemkvcon to rip video 
discs when they are inserted.

To start as a daemon, run:

   sudo /etc/init.d/autoripd start

Requirements:
  - unix/linux
  - udev
  - udisks
  - makemkvcon
  - HandBrakeCLI
  - mediainfo (if using plugins)

Features:
  - easily configurable
  - blu-ray and dvd main feature detection
  - names your files with the full movie title
  - plugin architecture for easily processing files after ripping
  - runs as a well-behaved daemon process
    - can run with reduced privileges (as a specified user) for 
      increased safety
    - protection against running multiple instances
    - configurable file creation permissions 
    - follows standard daemon conventions/commands
    - can run at startup
    - won't leave zombie processes when killed normally
    - well behaved logging
  - robust error handling:
    - a rip failure will not stop the daemon
    - partially complete rips can optionally be saved for 
      debugging/recovery

Important default file locations:
  Logfile:
     /var/log/autoripd/autoripd.log
  Configuration file:
     /etc/autoripd/autoripd.conf

Configuration settings:
   monitorDevices (list(string)): 
       Device(s) to monitor for disc insertion events. E.g. ["/dev/sr0"]
   destDir (string):
       Path of folder where the finished ripped video files will be placed
   tempRipDir (string):
       Path of folder where in-progress rips will go. Each job will get a 
       unique folder in this location. If `None`, then temporary 
       directories will be placed in `destDir`. It is a good idea for this 
       folder to be on the same filesystem as `destDir` to prevent 
       excessive copying.
   logfile (string):
       Path of file in which to log messages and errors.
   ejectDisc (bool):
       Whether to eject the disc after ripping is finished.
   leaveBrokenRips (bool):
       Whether to delete or save partially written video files when a 
       rip fails.
   verbose (bool):
       When set, outputs extra detailed debug information, including the 
       standard output of subprocesses like HandBrake and makemkvcon.
   enablePlugins (list(string)):
       List of names of plugins to enable. Each plugin will be loaded from 
       the plugins directory, then run in order on each rip result. 
       E.g. ["example", "remuxer"]
   user (string):
       Run the daemon as this user. It is recommended that a dedicated user 
       with non-root privileges and access to 'cdrom' be created for 
       maximum security and safety.
   group (string):
       Run the daemon as a member of this usergroup. User and group 
       privileges should be as restrictive as possible while still allowing 
       the daemon to perform its duties.
   umask (int):
       File mode creation mask of the daemon. This determines how the 
       permissions will be set on the ripped movie files. For universal 
       access, use umask 000.
   daemon_timeout (number):
       Seconds to wait for the daemon to start or stop before declaring an 
       error.
